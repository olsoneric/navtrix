Navtrix - A Transform class.
====================================================

Introduction
------------

Navtrix tracks position and rotation in a Transform class.

Status - In Development
------

This is a helper library that mainly includes a Transform class.  Transform
stores position as a vector and rotation as a Quaternion, and can output as
a matrix for OpenGL.

This will get more robust with more use.
